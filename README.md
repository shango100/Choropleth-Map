  2. **Description:**
     - The choropleth map has a description element with the corresponding id="description".
  3. **Counties Representation:**
     - The choropleth map has counties with a corresponding class="county" that represent the data.
     - There are at least 4 different fill colors used for the counties.
  4. **County Data Properties:**
     - Each county has data-fips and data-education properties containing their corresponding fips and education values.
  5. **Dataset Completeness:**
     - The choropleth map has a county for each provided data point.
     - The counties have data-fips and data-education values that match the sample data.
  6. **Legend:**
     - The choropleth map has a legend with a corresponding id="legend".
     - There are at least 4 different fill colors used for the legend.
  7. **Tooltip:**
     - Users can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.
  8. **Tooltip Data:**
     - The tooltip has a data-education property that corresponds to the data-education of the active area.
